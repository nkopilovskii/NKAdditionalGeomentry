## Description
The library is represented by a set of protocols and extensions of the CoreGraphics framework, which automate some geometric calculations.

## Interface
All the protocols described have a realization in extensions of the corresponding types

### Protocol `NKPoint`
```swift
/**
  Transformation of a point from one coordinate system to another

  - Parameters:
      - initial: `CGRect` of coordinate system which contains current `CGPoint` instance
      - destination: `CGRect` of coordinate system in which needs to get point corresponding to the current `CGPoint` instance

  - Returns: `CGPoint` in `destinationRect` coordinate system corresponding to current instance in `initialRect` coordinate system
*/
func similar(from initial: CGRect, in destination: CGRect) -> CGPoint

/**
  - Parameters:
      - point: `CGPoint` to which needs to calculate difference in values of the corresponding coordinates
  - Returns: `CGVector` difference in values of the corresponding coordinates
*/
func diffence(with point: CGPoint) -> CGVector

/**
  - Parameters:
      - difference: `CGVector` difference in values of the corresponding coordinates between two points
  - Returns: `CGPoint` by adding difference in values of the corresponding coordinates to current instance
*/
func point(byAdding difference: CGVector) -> CGPoint

/**
  - Parameters:
      - point: `CGPoint` to which needs to calculate the distance
  - Returns: `CGFloat` distance between current instance and `point`
*/
func distance(to point: CGPoint) -> CGFloat

/**
  - Parameters:
      - p1: `CGPoint` to which needs to calculate the distance
      - p2: `CGPoint` to which needs to calculate the distance
  - Returns: `CGFloat` angle between segments `instance-p1` and `instance-p2`
*/
func angle(with p1: CGPoint, _ p2: CGPoint) -> CGFloat

/**
  The method calculates equidistant points from the instance with an equal radial pitch between them.
  In other words, the method divides the circle into equal segments
  
  - Parameters:
      - count: `Int` count of devide points
      - radius: `CGFloat` remoteness of computed points from the instance
  - Returns: `[CGPoint]` array of equidistant points from the instance with an equal radial pitch between them
*/
func devidePoints(count: Int, for radius: CGFloat) -> [CGPoint]

/**
  The method calculates `CGPoint` at a given distance with the angle of deviation from the axis Ox
  
  - Parameters:
      - count: `Int` count of devide points
      - angle: `CGFloat` angle based on instance
  - Returns: `[CGPoint]` array of equidistant points from the instance with an equal radial pitch between them

### Protocol `NKVector`
```swift
/**
  Module (length) of the vector
*/
var length: CGFloat { get }

### Protocol `NKSize`
```swift
/**
  The method calculates the maximum size that can be accommodated in the given, with the remaining aspect ratio of the instance

  - Parameters:
      - size: `CGSize` in which it is necessary to place a new size
  - Returns: `CGSize` that can be accommodated in the `size`

      - destination: `CGSize` in the coordinate system of which needs to transfer the current object
  - Returns: `CGSize` corresponding to the instance, observing the ratios of the corresponding parameter given sizes
*/
func similar(from initial: CGSize, to destination: CGSize) -> CGSize
```

### Protocol `NKRect`
```swift
/// Center of the rectangle in the parent system
var center: CGPoint { set get }

/// Square of the maximum size in the center of instance
var centralSquare: CGRect { get }

/// Radius of a circle inscribed in instance

  - Parameters:
      - value: `CGFloat` value for increase instance's `size`
  - Returns: `CGRect` with instance's `origin` and instance's resized `size`
*/
func changedSize(with value: CGFloat) -> CGRect

/**
  The method calculates points at incircle radius distance from the instance's center with an equal radial pitch between them.
